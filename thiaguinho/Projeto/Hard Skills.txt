Hard Skills
C Programming Language:

            The primary language through the Basecamp, from the most basics as dealing with 
            operators, variables, pointers, memory allocation, libraries and more resources 
            to solve challanges and replicate existing standard functions.

Shell:          

            The first two lists are about Shell, going through simple to more complex commands 
            in command line, making you feel more comfortable using the terminal.

Git:

            All projects are submitted to a remote Git repository, so it is essential to learn it 
            since the first moment during Basecamp.
