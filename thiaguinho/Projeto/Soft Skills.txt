Soft Skills
Self-learning and Colaboration:

            At 42, self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology. There are no teachers whatsoever, 
            the learning process is based on searching, enquiring your classmates, each student learning at their own pace, 
            helping each other with their knowledge.

Time management and Resiliency:

            You can code 24/7, but there is a lot of work to do, and learning how to manage your time is extremelly important 
            to comply with all the schadule and resiliency for not drowing during the process.

Teamwork: 

            On weekends, a 48h team project called "Rush" is proposed: a 3-member group randomly chosen by the school's system 
            must collaboratively develop a fully running application. The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge levels 
            while finding a common work methodology that allows all team members to contribute to the project.

Empathy: 

            One of the most practiced soft skills during the whole process. It is important to notice that everyone has difficulties, 
            and it the important to take some time to talk to people and listen to them.
